Shorty
======

I wanted to try Hanami and ROM, so this is what I built.

A micro service to shorten urls, in the style that TinyURL and bit.ly.

1. The service must expose HTTP endpoints according to the definition below.
2. Use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/), the only command needed to run your project must be `docker-compose up`
